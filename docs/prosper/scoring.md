# Scoring

Version 2.0-draft · 17 September 2026 · HackSpain, 18–20 September 2026

This page is the automatic score: what passes a case, how points are counted, what the limits are, and what happens when a call fails. The jury's final boss is scored separately and is described in what the challenge is.

## What passes a case

A case passes or it fails. There is no partial credit within a case — not for a field, not for most of a name, not for an id that is one character out.

A case passes if the list of actions you submit matches one the case accepts, after normalization. What you submit and what each action carries is in the contract.

Doing nothing is not silence. A call whose right answer is "this cannot be booked" still submits a NO_ACTION carrying the reason. An empty list, or no submission at all, is always wrong — otherwise an agent that crashed would score the same as one that correctly refused.

Nothing about the conversation is scored here. Voice, manner, how personal the call felt and how well the load was spread all belong to the jury. See the scheduling guidelines for what to do with them.

More than one answer can be correct. "The earliest appointment with a GP" has three right answers when three GPs are free at the same minute. A case carries the set of acceptable outcomes and your submission passes if it matches any member. Scoring stays binary: it is membership, not partial credit.

Expected answers are computed through the same availability use case you call, so a case can never expect an appointment the API would not have offered.

## The two lanes

Practice dials one published case, answer and all. As often as you like within the rate limit. It scores nothing.

Run All is the scored lane: four private cases for every scored problem that is currently open, dialled 10 at a time. You choose nothing about it — the point of it is the whole open set. Take as many as you like, one at a time. It grows as problems open: the roster starts at two scored problems (8 calls, a couple of minutes) and ends at seventeen (68 calls, about eighteen). The problem set says what is open now.

Private cases are generated per run and their answers are never published.

While scoring is open, a private case tells you whether it passed, whose failure it was, and a failure signal such as missing_record or record_mismatch. It does not tell you which field lost, and it carries no transcript and no audio. Those open at the reveal — Monday 21 September, 00:00 Europe/Madrid — after the event has ended. The expected values are never published, before the reveal or after it.

Practice is the lane you debug in: a published case shows you its answer, the fields your record lost, the transcript and the recording, straight away. See recordings.

## Points

Every scored problem carries a difficulty weight from 1 to 5, published on the problem list and in the problem set. A problem's score is the fraction of its four cases that passed — 0, .25, .5, .75 or 1 — times that weight. Your score is the sum of those. There is no percentage and no denominator.

```
points = sum over problems of (its pass fraction × its weight)
```

Pass every case of The Real Call and 5 points go on the board; pass every case of The Simple Booking and 1 does. The most the full roster can give is 49.

A sum rather than a percentage because the set opens across the weekend. Under a percentage, the same agent's score would fall every time we released a problem it had not been built for — it would look like it was getting worse while it sat there unchanged. A sum only ever grows as you solve more, and a score from Friday means the same thing on Sunday.

A problem nobody attempted scores nothing, exactly like one that was dialled and failed. There is no credit for what you did not get to, so running only the problems you are good at buys nothing. A call that never produced a submission is an attempted, failed case: silence is never cheaper than a wrong answer.

The leaderboard ranks each team's best Run All. Not latest, which would punish experimenting late on Sunday; not cumulative, which would punish iterating at all. Best rewards the thing the weekend is for. It is not free of luck — four cases per problem is a sample — so the board shows how many runs backed a score beside it. Once the whole roster is open, a 70%-correct agent has no realistic chance of a perfect 49 across 68 calls.

Problem 2 scores nothing at all — it carries no weight and Run All never dials it. Practice calls never score either.

Problems open progressively. The set is released as each problem is verified end to end. What you have already earned is yours: opening a new problem never changes the score of a run that was taken before it, because there is no denominator for it to move.

Attributed harness failures are excluded rather than failed.

## Call limits

Every call is capped at three minutes — an agent that cannot book in three minutes has failed. A call is also cut off if it takes too long to connect or goes quiet, which means no audible audio from your agent: streaming silence keeps the socket open but counts as saying nothing, and the call is cut off and attributed to your agent.

A call cut off this way is still an attempt. Without an accepted record it scores nothing.

## What is not scored

- Voice quality, accent, naturalness, politeness, conversational style.
- Transcription accuracy on its own, or spelling aloud.
- The number or order of questions, tool calls or confirmations.
- Model choice, architecture, token usage, provider cost.
- Speed. Limits apply and can stop a valid record arriving, but being fast earns nothing.

A good conversation does not rescue a wrong record, and a clumsy one does not fail a right one. The one exception is problem 14, where the transcript is checked for leaked patient data.

## Corrections and disputes

A rule change is announced to every team, with the old and new wording, the reason and the effective time, before it takes effect. The wire and the submission schema stay backward compatible for the weekend. A change to matching, eligibility, points or deadlines is a scoring change even when it is a bug fix.

If a correction affects results already recorded, the decision on rejudging or exclusion is published for all affected teams before the standings move.

For a dispute, give an organiser your team, run and call ids, the rules version, the rule you expected and what you observed. See recordings; scored-case evidence is not released while scoring is open.

The wall freezes Sunday 20 September at 06:00 Europe/Madrid. Only runs completed at or before that instant count. Equal scores share a rank (1, 1, 3).

Private-case detail opens to each team at the reveal, Monday 21 September at 00:00 Europe/Madrid — after the stage final, so nothing can leak into it.

## When a call fails

Attribution is deterministic. No LLM arbiter decides whether a failure counts. Each settled case retains its comparison and observed failure signals.

| Evidence | Attribution | Run treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Matching record, no failure signals | none | Case passes |
| Missing/mismatching record, no infrastructure signal | agent_issue | Case fails |
| Endpoint unreachable, malformed agent message, or clean early hang-up | agent_issue | Case fails |
| No audible audio from your agent for the silence window | agent_issue | Case fails |
| Wall-clock limit, turn cap, unexplained disconnect, unidentified pipeline error | inconclusive | Case fails; evidence is available for investigation |
| Identified harness STT/LLM/TTS error, or confirmed local socket defect | harness_issue | Entire run is voided |
| Confirmed harness defect and independently observed agent failure | mixed | Entire run is voided |

A harness verdict requires a concrete component, problem, and fix attached to a recognised harness signal. An error label alone is not enough. A record mismatch or missing record during a harness failure does not independently prove an agent defect. TTS throttling reported through its error frames counts as a provider defect; slow speech alone does not prove throttling. A socket disconnect does not identify which host or network failed. ENETDOWN on the judge host does.

A voided run contributes no score and releases the cooldown for its own mode. It never triggers a silent rerun. The owning team's run API response contains status: "voided", a notification, and per-call attribution and signal codes. Request a replacement run explicitly. A later run can still occupy the team's active slot or start a new cooldown. Retrying delivery of an old settlement does not reset that later cooldown.

For evidence, organisers use the existing X-Admin-Key with GET /admin/teams/{team_id}/runs/{run_id}/evidence. It returns retained error details and concrete defects. This route is absent from the public OpenAPI schema. Team responses expose only identifiers, attribution, and fixed signal codes: raw provider errors, field names, private case contents and transcripts are never included in attribution feedback.

## Recordings

By connecting an agent to El Turno, you agree that calls are recorded as audio and timestamped transcripts for debugging, judging, dispute resolution and the Sunday stage; all practice and scored recordings are retained after the weekend, with no automatic deletion schedule.

Other teams can never read your recordings, and you can never read theirs.

### What you can read, and when

Which lane the call came from decides this, not who you are.

Practice calls are open as soon as they end. The case was published with its answer, so there is nothing left to protect: the transcript, the fields your record lost and the audio are all on your team page immediately.

Scored calls stay closed until the reveal — Monday 21 September, 00:00 Europe/Madrid. Until then a private case shows you whether it passed, whose failure it was and a failure signal, and nothing else: no transcript, no audio, no per-field comparison. At the reveal the transcript and the audio open to your team.

The expected answer to a private case is never published, before the reveal or after it. Which field you lost is feedback; the value it wanted is the answer key.

Organisers are not on this clock — they can read any team's private-case detail throughout the weekend, because they are who a verdict is disputed to and that has to be answerable before Sunday rather than after it.

### Transcripts

Transcripts are machine-generated. Their timestamps mark when recognised or spoken text reached the harness, not exact word boundaries. Audio is the source to consult when a transcript mishears a name, number or other detail.

## Still to be decided

Organisers confirm these before scored calls open. Until then, nothing in these docs implies an answer:

- How stage-final places are settled when qualifiers tie.
- The announcement channel for corrections, and who owns a dispute.
