# Get on the phone

From nothing to an agent answering a judged call. Budget an hour, most of it
waiting on API keys.

You are building **a WebSocket server that answers the phone**. We call it,
play a patient who wants an appointment, and your agent POSTs back what it
would have booked. There is no phone number and no Twilio account on your
side â just a socket.

## 1. Collect your account and key

**Organisers open your account â you do not register yourself.** There is no
sign-up form and no event code to type. Come to the registration desk with a
team name and one email address, and the desk reads back three things on one
screen:

| What | Used for |
|---|---|
| Your **email** | Signing in to the dashboard |
| A generated **dashboard password** | The same sign-in. You do not choose it |
| Your **API key** (\`pk-â¦\`) | Every request your agent makes |

**Copy all three before that screen is gone.** The key and the password are
shown there and nowhere else â neither is stored anywhere it can be read back.

A lost key is rotated at the desk, and the old one stops working. A lost
password means the desk revokes the account and opens a new one. There is no
reset email, so an address with a typo is an account only the desk can undo.

Extra teammates who want their own dashboard login are added at the desk
against the same team. The **API key belongs to the team, not to a person**:
there is one, and every agent on the team uses it.

The desk also hands over a **prepaid debit card with â¬100 on it, one per team**.
That is your budget for whatever your agent runs on â models, speech, telephony,
tunnels. Spend it how you like. It is not topped up and there is nothing to
claim back afterwards, so treat the card as the whole allowance.

\`\`\`bash
export PLATFORM_API_KEY=pk-...
export PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL=https://<the API host the desk gives you>

curl -sS "$PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/health"
curl -sS -H "X-Api-Key: $PLATFORM_API_KEY" \
  "$PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/directory?name=Marta%20Ruiz"
\`\`\`

Every route but \`/api/v1/health\` and the schema itself needs
\`X-Api-Key\`. Missing, invalid and revoked keys all return
\`403 {"detail":"Invalid API key"}\`. Another team's call or run is
indistinguishable from one that does not exist (\`404\`), and a request body
never chooses which team you are.

Prefer a browser: the [API reference](api.md) is the live schema. Press
*Authorize*, paste the key, and every endpoint is one *Execute* away.

## 2. Build your WebSocket server

There is no starter kit â building the thing that answers the phone is part
of the challenge. Your server speaks the wire format in
[the call contract](contract.md): Twilio's Media Streams protocol over a
plain WebSocket, no Twilio account or phone number needed.

Recommended: [pipecat](https://www.pipecat.ai/) for the voice pipeline â
speech to text, a model, speech back out. It ships a Twilio Media Streams
serializer and transport, and its own examples include a starter Twilio bot.

## 3. Expose it â ngrok

We call you from the internet, so \`localhost\` is unreachable. **ngrok is the
recommended tunnel**; anything that forwards WebSockets works.

\`\`\`bash
ngrok http 7860
\`\`\`

Your endpoint is that host with the \`wss://\` scheme and your socket's path:
\`https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok-free.app\` â \`wss://a1b2c3d4.ngrok-free.app/ws\`. Check
it with \`wscat -c wss://.../ws\` before handing it over.

Four things that bite teams:

- **A free ngrok URL changes every restart.** With an account, claim a static
  domain: \`ngrok http --url=your-name.ngrok-free.app 7860\`.
- **Pick a European region.** Audio is real-time 20ms frames; a tunnel routed
  through another continent adds delay to every one of them.
- **\`https://\` is not the endpoint.** The scheme is \`wss://\` and the path is
  whatever your server routes. Forgetting the path is the commonest mistake.
- **Keep the tunnel up for the whole run.** A dropped connection is a failed
  case, and Run All holds ten sockets open at once.

## 4. Tell us where to call you

The desk does not ask for an endpoint; every team starts on a placeholder. Set
the real one yourself, on the dashboard's **Settings** page, under
**Integration** â this is not a trip back to the desk.

Two fields:

| Field | What goes in it |
| --- | --- |
| **Endpoint** | \`wss://a1b2c3d4.ngrok-free.app/ws\` â scheme and path included |
| **Headers** | Optional. Anything the harness should send when it dials you, one per line: \`Authorization: Bearer â¦\` |

Saving replaces the whole configuration, so clearing the headers means none.
Header values are write-only: the page lists the names back, never the values.
A header WebSocket owns (\`Host\`, \`Connection\`, \`Upgrade\`, \`Sec-WebSocket-*\`)
is rejected, as is an endpoint that is not \`wss://â¦\` or \`ws://â¦\`.

The change applies to your **next** run: a run snapshots its endpoint when it
is admitted, so one already queued is dialled where it was queued.

## 5. Call yourself

The **Problems page** is the loop. Every call starts from there, and there are
two buttons:

| Button | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Call** | Beside each published case on a problem's Statement | One practice call on that case. Scores nothing |
| **Run All** | Top of the problems list | One scored run: private cases across every scored problem. This is the one the standings come from |

Each problem lists its public cases with their answers beside the button. For a
practice call the submissions tab gives you the transcript, the recording, and
which fields your record lost â never what they should have been. A run's page
shows its state and its per-case verdicts as they land, and cancelling one is
safe at any point.

Your records are also readable from your agent, for a health check or your own
tooling:

\`\`\`bash
curl -sS -H "X-Api-Key: $PLATFORM_API_KEY" \
  "$PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/submissions?limit=50"
\`\`\`

The problem ids behind the page are in [the problem set](problems.md).

**One queued or active run at a time**, in either lane; both buttons are
disabled while that slot is occupied. Two clocks on top of that: 30 seconds
between practice calls, and 15 minutes after your last Run All **finished**
before the next may start. The page counts the wait down for you. A Run All
takes about eighteen minutes, so expect to start one roughly every thirty-three.

Practice is where the feedback is. A **scored** case tells you only whether it
passed, whose failure it was and a failure signal until the reveal on Monday,
so debug against published cases and spend Run Alls on measuring. See
[scoring](rules.md).

## 6. What to build first

The score is binary per case: the actions you submit match one the case
accepts, or the case fails. There is no credit for a good conversation â that
is what the jury looks at instead. In rough order of points per hour:

1. **Identification.** Ask for a second identifier and use \`/directory\`'s
   exact fields â an exact field that does not match excludes the patient.
2. **The complete national id, including the check letter.** One wrong
   character fails the case.
3. **Refusals.** Several problems must be refused, not booked, and the
   \`reason\` has to name the rule that bit. Read the restriction metadata off
   \`/availability\` rather than guessing.
4. **The exact minute, with a timezone offset**, in Europe/Madrid.
5. **The appointment type.** It follows the patient and the specialty, never
   the request, and some specialties carry their own pair.
6. **Ten concurrent calls.** Everything per-socket, nothing shared.
7. **Turn-taking.** Interruption handling is entirely yours.
