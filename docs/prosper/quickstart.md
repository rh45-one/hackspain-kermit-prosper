# Get on the phone

From nothing to an agent answering a judged call. Budget an hour, most of it waiting on API keys.

You are building a WebSocket server that answers the phone. We call it, play a patient who wants an appointment, and your agent POSTs back what it would have booked. There is no phone number and no Twilio account on your side — just a socket.

## 1. Collect your account and key

Organisers open your account — you do not register yourself. There is no sign-up form and no event code to type. Come to the registration desk with a team name and one email address, and the desk reads back three things on one screen:

| What | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| Your email | Signing in to the dashboard |
| A generated dashboard password | The same sign-in. You do not choose it |
| Your API key (pk-…) | Every request your agent makes |

Copy all three before that screen is gone. The key and the password are shown there and nowhere else — neither is stored anywhere it can be read back.

A lost key is rotated at the desk, and the old one stops working. A lost password means the desk revokes the account and opens a new one. There is no reset email, so an address with a typo is an account only the desk can undo.

Extra teammates who want their own dashboard login are added at the desk against the same team. The API key belongs to the team, not to a person: there is one, and every agent on the team uses it.

The desk also hands over a prepaid debit card with €100 on it, one per team. That is your budget for whatever your agent runs on — models, speech, telephony, tunnels. Spend it how you like. It is not topped up and there is nothing to claim back afterwards, so treat the card as the whole allowance.

```
export PLATFORM_API_KEY=pk-...
export PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL=https://<the API host the desk gives you>

curl -sS "$PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/health"
curl -sS -H "X-Api-Key: $PLATFORM_API_KEY" \
  "$PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/directory?name=Marta%20Ruiz"
```

Every route but /api/v1/health and the schema itself needs X-Api-Key. Missing, invalid and revoked keys all return 403 {"detail":"Invalid API key"}. Another team's call or run is indistinguishable from one that does not exist (404), and a request body never chooses which team you are.

Prefer a browser: the API reference is the live schema. Press Authorize, paste the key, and every endpoint is one Execute away.

## 2. Build your WebSocket server

There is no starter kit — building the thing that answers the phone is part of the challenge. Your server speaks the wire format in the call contract: Twilio's Media Streams protocol over a plain WebSocket, no Twilio account or phone number needed.

Recommended: pipecat for the voice pipeline — speech to text, a model, speech back out. It ships a Twilio Media Streams serializer and transport, and its own examples include a starter Twilio bot.

## 3. Expose it — ngrok

We call you from the internet, so localhost is unreachable. ngrok is the recommended tunnel; anything that forwards WebSockets works.

```
ngrok http 7860
```

Your endpoint is that host with the wss:// scheme and your socket's path: https://a1b2c3d4.ngrok-free.app → wss://a1b2c3d4.ngrok-free.app/ws. Check it with wscat -c wss://.../ws before handing it over.

Four things that bite teams:

- A free ngrok URL changes every restart. With an account, claim a static domain: ngrok http --url=your-name.ngrok-free.app 7860.
- Pick a European region. Audio is real-time 20ms frames; a tunnel routed through another continent adds delay to every one of them.
- https:// is not the endpoint. The scheme is wss:// and the path is whatever your server routes. Forgetting the path is the commonest mistake.
- Keep the tunnel up for the whole run. A dropped connection is a failed case, and Run All holds ten sockets open at once.

## 4. Tell us where to call you

The desk does not ask for an endpoint; every team starts on a placeholder. Set the real one yourself, on the dashboard's Settings page, under Integration — this is not a trip back to the desk.

Two fields:

| Field | What goes in it |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint | wss://a1b2c3d4.ngrok-free.app/ws — scheme and path included |
| Headers | Optional. Anything the harness should send when it dials you, one per line: Authorization: Bearer … |

Saving replaces the whole configuration, so clearing the headers means none. Header values are write-only: the page lists the names back, never the values. A header WebSocket owns (Host, Connection, Upgrade, Sec-WebSocket-*) is rejected, as is an endpoint that is not wss://… or ws://….

The change applies to your next run: a run snapshots its endpoint when it is admitted, so one already queued is dialled where it was queued.

## 5. Call yourself

The Problems page is the loop. Every call starts from there, and there are two buttons:

| Button | Where | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Call | Beside each published case on a problem's Statement | One practice call on that case. Scores nothing |
| Run All | Top of the problems list | One scored run: private cases across every scored problem. This is the one the standings come from |

Each problem lists its public cases with their answers beside the button. For a practice call the submissions tab gives you the transcript, the recording, and which fields your record lost — never what they should have been. A run's page shows its state and its per-case verdicts as they land, and cancelling one is safe at any point.

Your records are also readable from your agent, for a health check or your own tooling:

```
curl -sS -H "X-Api-Key: $PLATFORM_API_KEY" \
  "$PLATFORM_API_BASE_URL/api/v1/submissions?limit=50"
```

The problem ids behind the page are in the problem set.

One queued or active run at a time, in either lane; both buttons are disabled while that slot is occupied. Two clocks on top of that: 30 seconds between practice calls, and 15 minutes after your last Run All finished before the next may start. The page counts the wait down for you. A Run All takes about eighteen minutes, so expect to start one roughly every thirty-three.

Practice is where the feedback is. A scored case tells you only whether it passed, whose failure it was and a failure signal until the reveal on Monday, so debug against published cases and spend Run Alls on measuring. See scoring.

## 6. What to build first

The score is binary per case: the actions you submit match one the case accepts, or the case fails. There is no credit for a good conversation — that is what the jury looks at instead. In rough order of points per hour:

- Identification. Ask for a second identifier and use /directory's exact fields — an exact field that does not match excludes the patient.
- The complete national id, including the check letter. One wrong character fails the case.
- Refusals. Several problems must be refused, not booked, and the reason has to name the rule that bit. Read the restriction metadata off /availability rather than guessing.
- The exact minute, with a timezone offset, in Europe/Madrid.
- The appointment type. It follows the patient and the specialty, never the request, and some specialties carry their own pair.
- Ten concurrent calls. Everything per-socket, nothing shared.
- Turn-taking. Interruption handling is entirely yours.
