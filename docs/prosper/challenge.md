# Who we are

Prosper builds voice AI for healthcare. Our agents pick up the phone for clinics and hospitals all day, and the single biggest thing those calls are about is scheduling.

Scheduling sounds simple until you look at a real clinic. Every appointment is the intersection of a patient, a provider, a location, a visit type, an insurance, a referral, a piece of equipment and a calendar — and every one of those carries rules. Who is allowed to see whom. Which visit types need a double slot. What counts as a new patient. Which of the four Maria Garcías born in the same decade is the one on the phone. A voice-to-voice model on its own does not know any of that, and it will happily invent an answer.

That is why the interesting work here is engineering, not prompting. The teams that do well at this problem in the real world are the ones that build around the model: retrieval over patient records, tools that can only return real availability, deterministic checks before anything is written, state that survives a caller changing their mind on the third turn, and observability good enough to explain why the agent said what it said. We encourage you to do exactly that this weekend — treat the voice model as one component of a system you designed, not as the system.

And the weekend is not only about passing cases. Half of what makes a voice agent usable is the platform around it: how the call is orchestrated, what you can see while it is happening, and what you can learn from it afterwards. Build that too — it is judged.

# The challenge

Build a voice AI agent that answers inbound scheduling calls for a clinic, the way a receptionist would.

Your agent picks up, talks to the patient, works out who they are and what they need, and uses the clinic's EHR — an electronic health record system, the healthcare equivalent of a CRM — to get it done. That means finding the patient and their chart, checking real availability, and creating, moving or cancelling the appointment. Some calls should not end in a booking at all, and recognising those is part of the job.

The challenge is posed as 18 problems, each with its own persona who calls your agent. They cover the range a real front desk sees: a straightforward booking, an ambiguous patient match, a caller who changes their mind mid-call, someone asking for something the clinic cannot give them, a bad line, a caller who is not the patient. You have to handle all of them — a single-path happy-flow agent will not get far.

You submit your agent, and we call it. We run every persona against it and check what your agent actually did against what the case accepts. Each problem you handle correctly earns points, and those points place you on the leaderboard.

# Who wins

The leaderboard decides the main prize. Every persona your agent handles correctly adds points; the team on top when the wall freezes wins.

Checkpoints. Twice over the weekend we freeze the board and hand a prize to whoever is leading at that moment, so being early pays. The desk announces the windows; a schedule published before the event reads as a commitment nobody made. To be in the running you need a registered team, a reachable endpoint and your key configured — see get on the phone. Organisers place smoke calls at every endpoint during the weekend to shake out problems early; those are practice and cost nothing if they fail.

The final boss. The jury calls your agent themselves and scores it separately, added to your total. Nothing here is automated: the same panel judges every team, and the desk announces the weights. Where a criterion touches something the board already scores — triage, languages, a caller who is not the patient — the jury is judging how it was done, never whether the record came out right.

- The patient experience. Whether it sounds like a person: pace and warmth, whether you can interrupt it and change your mind on the third turn, whether it repairs a mishearing instead of guessing loudly, and how long the caller spends for what they got. An agent that invents a slot, a doctor or a rule to keep the conversation moving is marked down hard, whatever it sounded like.
- How personal it gets. Whether the clinic sounds like it knows who is ringing. The chart is used before it is asked for — a caller seen eleven times is not asked whether they have been here before — and identification feels like recognition rather than an interrogation. The scheduling guidelines are written for this criterion.
- The platform you built around it. Judged on what you show, driven live in front of the jury rather than on a slide: how a call is actually run, what you can see while one is in flight, whether you can answer "why did it say that?" afterwards, and whether ten concurrent calls hold up. We are deliberately not scoping this one — surprise us.
- Safety and boundaries. An agent that is charming and unsafe scores worse than one that is plain and careful. It does not practise medicine, it escalates before it improvises, it knows who it is talking to and what it may read back, and it stays in character when the jury tries to talk it out of its own rules.
- Language and reach. The board checks the right language was used; the jury checks it was used well. Code-switching mid-call without a restart, Spanish names and national ids said the way a person says them, and patience with a caller who is elderly, hard of hearing or on a bad line.
- Engineering rigour. How you know it works, separately from whether it worked on the jury's call: your own evaluation harness, variance across repeated runs, the failure modes you can name, and what a call costs you in money and seconds.
- The jury's discretion. Held back deliberately — something nobody asked for, an idea worth stealing, a call that made the room go quiet. The panel awards it on its own judgement and justifies it against nothing above.

What does not earn points: the leaderboard score, the size of the diff, the model you picked in itself, and anything you cannot show working. A criterion the jury cannot observe on a call or in a demo is not scored, so demo what you built.

# Start here

Get on the phone takes you from nothing to an agent answering a judged call. Then the clinic for the rules you are working inside, and scoring for what passes.
