# The call contract

How a call reaches you, and what you POST when it ends. Frozen for the event: once your agent integrates, only additive changes happen — new optional fields, new reason values — never a breaking one.

## 1. How a call reaches you

You give us one WebSocket URL. When it is your turn we connect to it and speak exactly the wire format Twilio's Media Streams uses for a voice app, playing the part of the carrier. You need no Twilio account, no phone number and no telephony of your own — just a socket.

We send, in order:

- connected.
- start. Its start.callSid is the id for this call — this is the call_id you send back. Keep it. start.customParameters carries two more values, the way a Twilio stream parameter does:
  - call_id — the same id again, for convenience.
  - from_number — the number the caller is ringing from, in E.164 (+34612345678). It is the number the clinic holds for them, so GET /api/v1/directory?phone=+34612345678 finds their chart before they have said a word. The parameter is absent when the caller id is withheld, which is what a caller the clinic has no number for looks like — so treat it as a hint, never as identification. The caller is also not always the patient.
- media messages: 20ms frames of 8kHz µ-law audio, base64-encoded, in real time. This is the caller's voice.
- stop when the call ends on our side, then we close the socket.

The message shapes are Twilio's own — see their reference. Two easy-to-miss quirks: sequenceNumber, chunk and timestamp are strings on the wire, not numbers, and every key is camelCase.

Your agent talks back over the same socket with its own media messages. You may send mark and clear — they exist on the wire, but turn-taking and interruption are entirely yours. We implement no server-side barge-in; clear has no effect on our side today.

### More than one call at a time

One URL, many calls. A Run All opens ten sockets to your endpoint at once, each with its own start.callSid, overlapping for the whole conversation. Problem 2's largest burst opens twenty.

Everything a call owns — the conversation, its call_id, its submission — is per socket. Sharing one conversation, one session object or one in-flight call_id across sockets is the mistake this challenge looks for. Build a fresh pipeline per connection.

A refused or dropped connection is a failed call for the case it carried; the other calls in that wave continue and are scored normally.

## 2. The submission window

The window opens when we open the call and closes 30 seconds after our socket to you closes. Arriving early, before the call ends, is never a rejection reason — only arriving late is.

| Situation | Response |
| --- | --- |
| call_id was never one we called you on, or is another team's | 404 |
| Call still open, or closed at most 30s ago | 200 — accepted |
| Call closed more than 30s ago | 410 — window closed |
| An identical action was already accepted for this call | 409 |
| Malformed body | 422, and nothing is recorded |

A call's record is every action accepted inside its window. Most calls submit one; "cancel mine and my son's" submits two, one request each. An identical action twice is a retry and returns 409 — expected, not a bug. After the window every route returns 410: the deadline is checked before anything else. A 200 acknowledges receipt, not a pass.

## 3. POST /api/v1/submit/<action>

One route per action, each with the payload that action carries and nothing else. Send your desk-issued key in X-Api-Key. Attribution comes from the registered call session, never from a team id in the body.

The clinic is read-only, so nothing here mutates anything: you report the write you would have made.

```
POST /api/v1/submit/book

{
  "call_id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "patient_id": "P00042",
  "provider_id": "PR05",
  "location_id": "sur",
  "appointment_type_id": "review",
  "slot": "2026-09-24T16:30:00+02:00",
  "policy_id": "sanitas"
}
```

| Route | Body, besides call_id |
| --- | --- |
| POST /submit/register | given_name, first_surname, second_surname, national_id, date_of_birth, phone, email, insurer |
| POST /submit/book | patient_id, provider_id, location_id, appointment_type_id, slot, policy_id |
| POST /submit/reschedule | appointment_id, provider_id, location_id, slot, policy_id |
| POST /submit/cancel | appointment_id |
| POST /submit/no-action | reason |
| POST /submit/escalate | reason |

register is for a caller the directory does not know: nothing is booked, the demographics are the answer. A patient who is not on the chart cannot be booked at all — see the scheduling guidelines. Every one of its fields is scored after normalization, and national_id re-derives its own check letter — which is what separates a misheard digit from an invented one. A national_id whose letter does not match its digits is 422.

book names a patient already on file by patient_id, which comes from the directory — never from what the caller said.

policy_id is which of the patient's plans the appointment is billed against. A patient may hold two and only one may cover what they asked for, so naming it is part of the answer rather than a detail the clinic can infer. appointment_id comes from the appointments lookup; there is no other source for one.

slot must carry an explicit timezone offset. It converts to Europe/Madrid and must match to the exact minute.

### reason

Closed vocabulary. The first eleven mirror the clinic's own restrictions one-for-one, so a rule that bit can always be reported — a test enforces that, because a rule with no way to say it makes its case unanswerable:

not_eligible_age · referral_required · provider_not_in_network · specialty_not_covered · location_not_covered · insurer_referral_required · allowance_exhausted · provider_on_leave · location_hours · type_not_offered · patient_history

The rest cover endings that are not about a clinic rule:

no_availability · clinic_closed · patient_not_found · provider_not_found · caller_not_authorised · out_of_scope · medical_emergency

Response (200): {"call_id": "…", "received_at": "…", "record": {"actions": [...]}} — every action accepted for this call so far, this one included, in the shape the record readback returns it: each with an action verb (REGISTER, BOOK, RESCHEDULE, CANCEL, NO_ACTION, ESCALATE) and its fields; a REGISTER nests its fields under new_patient.

## 4. Gotchas

- /submit/*'s JSON is plain snake_case. camelCase applies only to the Twilio-shaped handshake in §1.
- Each request is one action. A call that does two things posts twice, to the route each thing belongs to.
- The call_id you submit is exactly start.callSid. Don't mint your own.
- Ids are compared exactly. There is nothing to normalize about PR05.
- Submitting nothing always fails. See scoring.
- Every field of every route is in the API reference; this page is the protocol and the deadline, which the schema cannot state.
