# Scoring: the normalization table

Generated directly from the scorer's own normalization code, not hand-edited â
the examples below are the same ones that code is tested against, so this
table cannot say something the code doesn't do.

Scoring is binary per case: the actions you submit match a set the case
accepts, or the case fails. What follows is the tolerance â what's forgiven
and what isn't. The actions themselves are in
[the contract](contract.md); the points are in [the rules](rules.md).

## Where normalization applies

Ids are compared **exactly**. There is nothing to normalize about \`PR05\`, and
pretending otherwise would let a near-miss provider pass. Normalization
applies only where a human voice was in the loop: the demographics a
\`REGISTER\` captures for a patient who is not yet on file, and the moment of
the appointment. All the tolerance in scoring lives in those two places.

Every accent-insensitive fold below uses the same rule: Unicode NFKD
decomposition with combining marks stripped. That is a deliberate
simplification, not an oversight â it also folds "ñ" to plain "n", so a
surname spelled with and without its tilde is treated as the same submission.


## National id (DNI or NIE)

| Submitted | Normalizes to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| \`12345678-Z\` | \`12345678Z\` | dash stripped, letter already uppercase |
| \`12345678z\` | \`12345678Z\` | lowercase letter uppercased |
| \`1234 5678 Z\` | \`12345678Z\` | internal whitespace stripped, not just the ends |
| \`x-1234567-l\` | \`X1234567L\` | a NIE normalizes the same way |

## Captured patient name

| \`José López García\` | \`jose {garcia, lopez}\` | surname order does not matter |
| \`Ana Muñoz Ruiz\` | \`ana {munoz, ruiz}\` | deliberate simplification: "ñ" folds to plain "n" |
